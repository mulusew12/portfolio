    <p id="more">My name is Mulusew Wassie, and I am 22 years old. I am currently a second-year
        Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Addis Ababa Science and 
        Technology University. In addition to my studies, I am also an entry-level web developer, specializing in front-end development. While my academic focus is on Electrical and Computer Engineering, I have a strong passion for web development and have been actively learning and building my skills in this area. I am particularly interested in creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces, and I am dedicated to improving my expertise in front-end development alongside my engineering education. Balancing both fields is challenging but rewarding,
        as it allows me to explore my technical and creative interests simultaneously.
